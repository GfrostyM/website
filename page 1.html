<h3> story about my day</h3>

<p>My day has been pretty normal so far, I woke up this morning and got ready as usual but I was almost late to school. This is because the was <b>massive amounts of traffic</b>. I belive that this was becuse of a crash that happened on the motorway. Anyway I got to school barely in time and went to maths. We were just doing some practice algebra qeustions and Ms B wasn't even teaching us anything. After that I PE where we talked with Mr wright and then answered some questions about different groups we had been in. We played cards in HUI AKO and I did pretty <b>shit.</b></p>
